## My Favorite Movie: The Princess Bride

One of my all-time favorite movies is **The Princess Bride**. I love this film because of its **perfect blend of adventure, romance, and humor**. The movie has unforgettable quotes, a fantastic cast, and a timeless story filled with sword fights, witty dialogue, and true love. Cary Elwes' performance as Westley, along with the filmâ€™s charm and humor, makes it an all-time classic that I can watch over and over again.
