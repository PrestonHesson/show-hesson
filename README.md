<h3>Favorite Food: Bacon </h3>
<p>
    I love Bacon because it <b>so versitly</b>. it something that can stand on it own and be something amazing if you mix it with something else. also there is <b>so many different kinds of bacon and way you can cook</b> it that honestly anyone could love bacon as long as they are not vegan.
